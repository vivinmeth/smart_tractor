|========================================================|

The Raptor T2 is an IOT based Autonomous Tractor with Arduino as its Brain. It was a prototype inspired by the Mahindra Smart Tractor but fully electric and autonomous. It was also inspired by the Interstellar farm tractors. The Prototype had the ability to detect obstacles and avoid them. The logic was preliminary to make it work with just Arduino as it's the brain. We planned it to be modular with the attachments and the prototype had a servo-based plowing attachment.
